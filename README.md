# Hibrid Models

Here I will keep my hybrid IA models

## Descriptions

* ACO.py - ACO class to be use in any function
* AGEnsembleResidual.py - Hibrid model with Ensembles to correct residual of arima/sarima/sarimax
* AGMLPResidual.py - Hibrid model with MLPs correct residual of arima/sarima/sarimax
* AgMlp.py - AG otimization of MLPs
* EnsembleSearch.py - AG otimization of Ensembles

## PSO

A vary good package https://pyswarms.readthedocs.io/en/latest/intro.html

### Binary

use like my ACO

https://pyswarms.readthedocs.io/en/latest/api/pyswarms.discrete.html#module-pyswarms.discrete.binary

## TODO

### ACO

* Make some plot methods with the Dij matix and the antsHistory
* Genetic Ant Colony Optimization is a thing

### AGMlp

* possibility of return bests groups of MLPs not Best MLP

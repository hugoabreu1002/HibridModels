# Hibrid Models

Here I will keep my hybrid IA models

## Description of Classes

ACO.py - ACO class to be use in any function
AGEnsembleResidual.py - Hibrid model with Ensembles to correct residual of arima/sarima/sarimax 
AGMLPResidual.py - Hibrid model with MLPs correct residual of arima/sarima/sarimax 
AgMlp.py - AG otimization of MLPs
EnsembleSearch.py - AG otimization of Ensembles

## To fix

### ACO

* The real best solution its not the mode, but the best ant in each wave..
* Make some plot methods with the Dij matix and the antsHistory
